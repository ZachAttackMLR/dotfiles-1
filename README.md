# Aaron's Dotfiles

These are written for `macOS` with `Linux` compatibility in mind. Automatically backed up with [`shallow-backup`](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup).

My default setup consists mainly of:

- `git`
- `tmux`
- `neovim`
- `zsh`

The `XDG Base Directory Specification` is followed as much as possible. 

## Notes

### `zsh` Config

`~/.zprofile` must be in the `$HOME` directory, however, the rest of the `zsh` config files live in `~/.config/zsh/`.
